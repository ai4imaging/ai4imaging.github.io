# AI4Imaging Lab Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 🚀 部署到GitHub Pages

### 自动部署（推荐）

1. **创建GitHub仓库**
   - 在GitHub上创建一个新仓库
   - 仓库名称建议为：`yourusername.github.io` （用于个人主页）或任意名称

2. **上传项目到GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **启用GitHub Pages**
   - 进入GitHub仓库的Settings > Pages
   - Source选择"GitHub Actions"
   - 推送代码后会自动部署

### 手动部署

如果不想使用GitHub Actions，也可以手动部署：

```bash
# 构建项目
npm run build

# 部署到gh-pages分支
npm run deploy
```

然后在GitHub仓库设置中启用Pages，选择source为"gh-pages branch"。

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
